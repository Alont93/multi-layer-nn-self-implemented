# multi-layer-nn-self-implemented
Classification of handwritten digits using neural network written with NumPy only

Classification of MNIST dataset for handwritten digits using configurable NN assembled with hidden layer implemented with back propagation algorithms and three different activation functions.

This porject includes:
* MNIST dataset encoding.
* Configurably sized dense neural network implementations.
* Sigmoid, ReLU and Tanh functions and derivations implementations.
* Backpropagation based on derivation of loss made by us, using numerical approximation implementation.
* Training using gradient descent with configurable learning rates and momentum.
* Acuraccy visualizations.
