# Multi-layer Neural Networks for MNIST Dataset

We implement multi-layer neural network to classify the MNIST dataset in Python.

## Required Packages
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Pickle

## Dataset
We use the MNIST dataset for this neural network

## Activation Functions
We have softmax as our output activation function, and have
* sigmoid,
* ReLU,
* tanh
to be our activation functions for hidden layers.
